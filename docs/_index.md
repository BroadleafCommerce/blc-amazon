## Broadleaf Commerce Community Module

# Amazon

The blc-amazon module adds support for amazon functionality.   Currently, this includes a an *Amazon S3* compatible `FileServiceProvider` implementation. 

The BroadleafFileService uses providers when working with files that are created by the system.   This includes images and other media uploaded through the Broadleaf Admin as well as files generated by the sytem like the one generated by the SiteMap generation process.

A distributed storage (like Amazon S3) is needed when running in a multi-server environment to ensure that images loaded on one server
are available to the others in the cluster.  Other common alternatives are to use a shared drive via an NFS mount and configuring the default FileSystemFileServiceProvider to use that directory.

## Module Configuration
To use the blc-amazon module requires you to have an amazon aws account with s3 capabilities and some basic Broadleaf Commerce configuration.

For detailed instructions on how to integrate the amazon module into your project, see [[Module Installation]].
