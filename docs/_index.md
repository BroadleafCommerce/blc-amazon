## Broadleaf Commerce Community Module

# Amazon

The blc-amazon module adds support for amazon functionality.   Currently, this includes a an *Amazon S3* 
compatible `FileServiceProvider` implementation. 

The BroadleafFileService uses providers when working with files that are created by the system.   This includes images and 
other media uploaded through the Broadleaf Admin as well as files generated by the sytem like the one generated by the 
SiteMap generation process.

A distributed storage (like Amazon S3) is needed when running in a multi-server environment to ensure that images loaded on 
one server are available to the others in the cluster.  Other common alternatives are to use a shared drive via an NFS mount 
and configuring the default FileSystemFileServiceProvider to use that directory.
