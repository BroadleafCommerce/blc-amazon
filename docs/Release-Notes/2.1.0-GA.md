# Amazon S3 Version 2.1.0-GA

_Released August 16th, 2017_

## New and Noteworthy

- Minimum requirement on Broadleaf 5.2. Broadleaf 5.0 and 5.1 users can continue to use S3 version 2.1
- Update the AWS SDK from 1.9.27 to 1.11.170 and target the dependency to _only_ pull in the S3 API instead of the entirety of the S3 APIs
- [Add support for SSE which encrypts uploads server-side](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/blc-amazon/pull/13) (special thanks to [@moneymikeMD](https://github.com/moneymikeMD)!)

## Deprecations

The `aws.s3.endpointURI` is no longer used with the AWS SDK updates. The authorization endpoint is now auto-determined from the region set by `aws.s3.defaultBucketRegion`.
